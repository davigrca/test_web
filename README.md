# Test Automation
This project uses JavaScrip + Node.JS and [Webdriver IO](https://webdriver.io/) to automate test cases for https://www.grocerycrud.com/demo/bootstrap_theme.

I set up this project mostly just following their [Getting Started tutorial](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html).

WebdriverIO is the Selenium backbone of the test project. However, I needed another framework to actually allow me to test what happened, which is called Mocha.

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS locally.

2. Clone this repository into a local folder.

3. Run `npm install` to install the package dependencies.

4. Run `npm run test`. You should see a browser open and a test case runs.
